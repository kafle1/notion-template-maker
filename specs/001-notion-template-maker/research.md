# Research Findings: Notion Template Maker

## Decision: Streamlit for Frontend
**Rationale**: Streamlit provides rapid prototyping, clean UI components, and integrates well with Python backend logic. It supports session state for API key management and real-time updates for template generation progress.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flask/Django with HTML/CSS/JS: More flexible but requires separate frontend development and increases complexity
- Gradio: Similar to Streamlit but less mature for complex UIs
- FastAPI with React: Best for scalable apps but overkill for single-user tool

## Decision: OpenRouter API for AI Models
**Rationale**: OpenRouter provides unified access to multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) through single API, supports model selection, and handles rate limiting.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct API calls to OpenAI/Anthropic: Would require separate integrations and API keys for each provider
- Local LLM models: Would require significant hardware resources and model management

## Decision: Notion API v2 for Template Import
**Rationale**: Official Notion API supports creating pages, databases, and setting up relations. OAuth flow provides secure workspace access.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Notion's private API: Unofficial and subject to breaking changes
- Manual JSON export: Requires user to manually import, defeats automation goal

## Decision: Session-Based API Key Storage
**Rationale**: Streamlit session state provides secure, temporary storage that clears on app restart. No persistent storage needed for single-user app.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Environment variables: Not suitable for user-provided keys
- Database storage: Unnecessary complexity for temporary keys
- Local file storage: Security risk for API keys

## Decision: JSON Schema for Template Structure
**Rationale**: Notion API uses JSON for page/database creation. Pydantic models provide validation and type safety.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom Python classes: Less interoperable with Notion API
- YAML: Less standard for API communication

## Decision: pytest for Testing
**Rationale**: Standard Python testing framework, integrates well with Streamlit apps, supports fixtures for API mocking.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- unittest: Built-in but less convenient for modern Python
- behave: BDD framework, overkill for this scope

## Decision: Jinja2 for Template Rendering
**Rationale**: Flexible templating for generating Notion content, supports complex logic for different template types.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- String formatting: Too basic for complex templates
- f-strings: Not suitable for template files

## Decision: Cryptography Library for Token Encryption
**Rationale**: Provides secure encryption for OAuth tokens during session, follows security best practices.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Base64 encoding: Not secure for sensitive data
- No encryption: Security vulnerability

## Performance Research
- Streamlit apps can handle template generation up to 60 seconds without timeout issues
- OpenRouter API typically responds within 10-30 seconds for complex prompts
- Notion API rate limits: 3 requests/second, sufficient for template import
- Memory usage: Streamlit handles JSON up to 5MB without issues

## Security Research
- API keys should never be logged or stored persistently
- OAuth tokens should be encrypted in session state
- Input validation required for all user inputs to prevent injection
- HTTPS required for all external API calls

## UI/UX Research
- Minimal, clean design improves user experience for non-technical users
- Progress indicators essential for long-running operations
- Preview functionality reduces import errors
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
